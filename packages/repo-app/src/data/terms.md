## **15\. Payment of Fees**

### **15.1. Plans**

The Services will be provided according to the plan level you select. There is a free hobby plan and there are paid self-service subscription plans ("self-service subscriptions"). For an enterprise license, you may contact Repo.md separately. You may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other plan level that Repo.md offers at any time during the period of your plan; provided that a downgrade will not be effective until the next renewal date. For self-service subscriptions, additional Services added to your self-service subscription, and domain registrations, you will be charged a fee and any applicable tax. Fees will be billed to the credit card or other payment account you provide in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You acknowledge and agree that Repo.md will automatically charge your credit card or other payment account on record with Repo.md in connection with your use of the Services: (i) in advance of each self-service subscription term, for the self-service subscription you have selected and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription; (ii) in arrears for any additional Services you have used or added to your self-service subscription during the prior self-service subscription term; and (iii) on purchase of any domain registration and up to thirty (30) days prior to each annual anniversary of your purchase. The self-service subscription and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription will automatically-renew for the same term as the initial term. You represent and warrant to Repo.md that all of your payment information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. If payment is not received or cannot be charged to your credit card or other payment account for any reason in advance, Repo.md reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Services and terminate this Agreement and for domain registrations, Repo.md may not register the domain or may allow the domain registration to expire.

### **15.2. Payments**

All payments shall be made in the currency of, and within the borders of the United States. You will pay all applicable taxes, duties, withholdings, backup withholding and the like; when Repo.md has the legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be paid by you directly to Repo.md. If all or any part of any payment owed to Repo.md under this Agreement is withheld, based upon a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to Repo.md of the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement. You will reimburse Repo.md any pre-approved and agreed upon costs. Repo.md may change its fees and payment terms at its discretion; provided however, that such changes will not take effect for you until the start of the next payment period. Repo.md will provide written notice to you for any changes to the fees that affect the Services purchased by you. Your continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.

## **16\. Term and Termination**

Subject to earlier termination as provided below, the term of this Agreement will commence on your acceptance of this Agreement and will continue for as long as the Services are being provided to you under this Agreement. The term of your hobby plan, self-service subscription, and any Services purchased or added to your self-service subscription, shall automatically renew for successive terms equal in duration to the initial term unless you cancel your hobby plan or self-service subscription in advance of the renewal date. You have the right to terminate your account (or downgrade your Pro account to a hobby account) at any time by sending a cancellation request to Repo.md Support via the [Help page](https://repo.md/help) provided that such termination will be effective at the start of the next renewal period. Subject to earlier termination as provided below, Repo.md may terminate your account and this Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days prior notice to the administrative email address associated with your account. In addition to any other remedies Repo.md may have, Repo.md may also terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days' notice (or two (2) days in the case of nonpayment), if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Repo.md may terminate your account and this Agreement immediately if you exceed any Repo.md limits concerning use of the Services, including without limitation, the maximum period of time that data, code or other content will be retained by the Services, the maximum storage space that will be allotted on Repo.md's servers on your behalf, and the maximum compute capacity provided for the execution of builds and functions and the maximum network data transferred by the Services. You acknowledge that Repo.md reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time and the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by Repo.md upon any termination of your account. If Repo.md terminates your account without cause and you have signed up for a self-service subscription, Repo.md will refund the pro-rated, unearned portion of any amount that you have prepaid to Repo.md for such Services.

### **16.2. Survival**

### **20.3 Exclusive Jurisdiction and Venue; Arbitration.**

#### **20.3.1 Disputes with a Domestic Customer**

If you are located and headquartered in the United States of America, you and Repo.md each irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the San Francisco County, California for all proceedings arising out of this contract or related to the parties' relationship, and you and Repo.md agree to only institute such proceedings in those courts. You and Repo.md also waive any objection to venue in those courts based on improper venue. You and Repo.md agree that a final judgment (subject to appeals) in any such proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in another lawful manner.

#### **20.3.2. Disputes with a Foreign Customer**

If you are located and headquartered outside of the United States of America, then any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law. Any dispute between you and Repo.md that is not resolved through negotiation will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then-current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of you and Repo.md or, if you and Repo.md cannot agree, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the JAMS rules who shall be experienced in the type of dispute at issue. You and Repo.md, their representatives, the arbitrator, and other participants shall keep confidential the existence, content, and result of the arbitration. Any demand for arbitration and any counterclaim must specify in reasonable detail the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the claimant's claims and include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed, if any, and any other remedy sought by the claimant. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language; the location of such arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Each party will bear its own costs in the arbitration. The arbitrator will have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to interpret or construe the provisions of the agreement documents and to fashion appropriate remedies (including temporary, preliminary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief); provided that the arbitrator will not have any right or authority: (i) in excess of the authority that a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the dispute would have absent this arbitration agreement; or (ii) to award damages in excess of the types and limitation of damages found in the Agreement. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, each party may apply at any time to a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate injunctive relief or for other interim or conservatory measures, and by doing so will not breach or waive the agreement to arbitrate or impair the powers of the arbitrator.
