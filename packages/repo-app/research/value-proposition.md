# Value Proposition & Pitch Strategy

## 🎯 The Core Pitch

### One-Liner
**"Markdown on your computer, deployed everywhere, powered by AI."**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"We're reinventing content management for the modern web. Your content lives as markdown files on your computer - no vendor lock-in. Push to Git and it's instantly deployed worldwide. AI handles the boring stuff like SEO and image optimization. Developers can build custom apps without boilerplate. It's how content management should work in 2024."

### Extended Pitch (2 minutes)
"Traditional CMSs trap your content in proprietary databases. Cloud platforms lock you into their ecosystem. We believe your content should live where you work - on your computer, in simple markdown files you can edit with any tool.

But local files are just the beginning. Push to Git and your content deploys instantly to a global edge network. Every branch gets a preview URL. AI agents help create content, optimize images, and handle SEO automatically.

For developers, our SDK eliminates boilerplate. Connect AI agents with built-in MCP support. Build anything from simple blogs to complex applications. 

This isn't just another CMS - it's a complete platform that respects how modern creators and developers actually work."
