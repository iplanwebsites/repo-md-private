Full name Demis Bellot, I'm a seasoned developer who spends much time on the Internet and developing software, most of which lies behind the browser. Always striving for languages and tools in helping achieve the 'perfect code', In my mind that is flexible code with good design that is both quick to develop and can perform and scale well.

Current weapons of choice: C# / Visual Studio.NET / Re-Sharper.

Also currently active in: - Ajax, Flash and Silverlight - Python / Google App Engine - Objective-C and the iPhone SDK

You can see some of my work as the lead developer of the following open source projects:

**Service Stack -** [http://code.google.com/p/servicestack](http://code.google.com/p/servicestack) A .NET framework for rapidly developing SOA like web services without any configuration or any RPC-style WCF service or operation contracts. Each service is immediately discoverable and callable via SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2, XML, JSON and REST style web services.

**Ajax Stack -** [http://code.google.com/p/ajaxstack](http://code.google.com/p/ajaxstack) An AJAX framework for developing pure AJAX applications like gmail or google maps. Development of your application is kept in logical order, i.e. HTML for page content, CSS for your website style and JavaScript for  website's functionality. The framework handles compiling your entire website into a single static JavaScript file that can be easily versioned and served from any web server.
