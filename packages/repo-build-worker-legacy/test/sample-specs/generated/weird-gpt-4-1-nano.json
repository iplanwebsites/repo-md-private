  "original": "# WeirdPressPhoto Repo.md Specification\n\n## 1. Summary\n\n**AI-generated photojournalism exhibition platform** - WeirdPressPhoto showcases powerful visual narratives addressing global issues through the lens of contemporary photojournalism. Modeled after World Press Photo standards, the project creates fictional award-winning photo series that explore real-world events with artistic vision and journalistic integrity. Each series features 7 images with comprehensive storytelling, photographer bios, and professional presentation.\n\n## 2. Content\n\n### Content Voice\n\n**Professional photojournalism narrative** - Authoritative yet accessible, balancing emotional impact with factual accuracy. Write series statements that contextualize without editorializing. Captions should be precise and informative. Avoid formulaic descriptions - each series demands its own narrative approach. Maintain dignity when depicting suffering and complexity when addressing global issues.\n\n### Content Structure\n\n**Clear separation between research and final exhibition content**:\n\n**Internal Research** (`/internal/year/`):\n\n- **Theme Research**: `themes-list.md` - Initial compilation of 50+ events into 30 themes\n- **Creative Development**: `/themes/[num]-[theme-name].md` - 3 concepts per theme with judge evaluations\n- **Selection Notes**: `selected-concepts.md` - Final decisions and rationale\n\n**Published Exhibition** (`/year/`):\n\n- **Photo Series**: `/series/[num]-[series-slug].md` - Final polished series with statement, bio, captions\n- **Series Assets**: `/assets/[num]-[series-slug]/` - 7 photos + photographer portrait\n\nThe internal folder contains all working documents, research, brainstorming, and judge discussions. The published folders contain only the final, exhibition-ready content that viewers would see.\n\n**File Structure Example**:\n\n```\n/project-root/\n  /internal/\n    /2024/\n      themes-list.md\n      /themes/\n        1-climate-crisis.md (research + 3 concepts + judges)\n        2-digital-rights.md\n      selected-concepts.md\n  /2024/\n    /series/\n      1-rising-tides-maldives.md (final series)\n      2-silicon-shadows.md\n    /assets/\n      /1-rising-tides-maldives/\n        photo-1.png through photo-7.png\n        photographer-portrait.png\n```\n\n### Visual Style\n\n**Award-winning photojournalism standards** - Each series maintains consistent visual language while exploring unique approaches (documentary, artistic, long-term projects). Images predominantly landscape format with strategic use of square/portrait. Always include technical specifications (camera, lens, settings) and quality markers (\"World Press Photo winner\", \"award-winning photojournalism\"). No captions rendered on images - text separate.\n\n**Prompt Construction**:\n\n1. Subject and action with specific details\n2. Exact location (city, country)\n3. Camera angle and framing\n4. Technical specs (e.g., \"Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, 85mm f/1.4\")\n5. Lighting and compositional techniques\n6. Mood and atmosphere\n7. Award-winning keywords\n\n## 3. Agent Actions\n\n### Produce Annual Exhibition\n\n**Creates complete photojournalism exhibition through three phases**:\n\n**Phase 1 - Research**:\n\n- Web search for 50+ significant events across categories:\n  - Science & Technology breakthroughs\n  - Political developments & elections\n  - Environmental crises & climate events\n  - Social movements & protests\n  - Sports & cultural milestones\n  - Health & pandemic developments\n  - Economic shifts & labor movements\n  - Migration & displacement patterns\n- Run multiple searches per category to dig deeper than surface-level news\n- Compile into 30 major themes (group by category, include misc for outliers)\n- For each theme: write 3-4 sentence description with factual details (dates, names, stats, sources)\n- Output: `/internal/year/themes-list.md` - comprehensive document with all theme details\n\n**Phase 2 - Creative Development**:\nFor each of the 30 themes, create extensive brainstorming document:\n\n- **3 Distinct Series Concepts**, each including:\n\n  - Fictional photographer name (random first + last name fitting their backstory)\n  - Visual treatment and photojournalism approach\n  - The \"secret sauce\" - what makes this approach special\n  - Visual style details (genre, framing, techniques)\n  - Photographer's backstory and process\n  - How it connects to theme (can be loosely tied, not literal)\n  - 3 potential series titles (9 total per theme)\n\n- **Judge Evaluation Panel**: 5 fictional World Press Photo judges with different personas evaluate all 3 concepts on:\n\n  - Visual appeal potential\n  - Scope (too broad/narrow?)\n  - Visual originality (avoiding literal treatments)\n  - Thematic originality\n  - Overall quality and credibility\n  - Relevance for exhibition\n  - Potential impact\n  - Narrative angle\n\n- **Final Selection**: Compare concepts and select strongest approach, focusing on:\n\n  - Singular, focused treatments over universal coverage\n  - Beauty in narrow, specific stories (e.g., one family, one location)\n  - Creative potential and interesting execution\n  - Detailed outline of specific photos in the series\n\n- Output: `/internal/year/themes/[num]-[theme-name].md` files\n\n**Phase 3 - Production**:\n\n- Load selected concept from Phase 2 research\n- Write complete series file with all required elements\n- Generate 7 images using detailed prompts:\n  - Favor landscape format (most common in World Press Photo)\n  - Use square/portrait where narratively appropriate\n  - No captions rendered on images\n  - Include \"world press photo award winning photo series\" in prompts\n- Keep theme number in filename for tracking\n- Output: `/year/series/[num]-[series-slug].md` with all images in `/assets/`\n\n### Create News Story\n\n**Produces timely photojournalism from current events**:\n\n- Monitor breaking news and emerging global stories\n- Identify events with strong visual narrative potential\n- Develop unique angle and fictional photographer approach\n- Generate condensed photo series (5 images)\n- Output: `/year/news/[date]-[story-slug].md`\n\n## 4. Agent Tools\n\n- **web_search**: Research real-world events, verify facts, find detailed context\n- **image_generation**: Create professional photojournalism images (landscape/portrait/square)\n- **file_operations**: Manage complex project structure and asset organization\n- **trend_analysis**: Identify significant global events and emerging issues\n\n_Primary tools for this project: web_search (heavy use), image_generation, file_operations_\n\n## 5. Self-Management\n\n**Execution triggers**:\n\n**Annual Exhibition**:\n\n- Manually triggered once per year\n- Executes \"Produce Annual Exhibition\" action\n- Generates 30 complete photo series for that year's exhibition\n\n**News Stories**:\n\n- Daily random check (1/7 chance)\n- When triggered, executes \"Create News Story\" action\n- Produces single photo story in `/year/news/`\n\nThe agent operates only when triggered - either manually for annual exhibitions or through random daily activation for news stories.\n\n## 6. Public Persona\n\n### Personality\n\n**The exhibition curator** - Knowledgeable, respectful, and passionate about photojournalism's power to create change. When discussing series, emphasize the human stories behind global issues. Happy to explain photographic techniques, historical context, or the fictional photographers' approaches.
