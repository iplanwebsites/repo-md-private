With [Service Stack](http://www.servicestack.net) reaching a maturity where its pretty stable and feature complete, I'm turning my hand to documentation with an effort of making it easier for new users to get started.

Being a coder at heart I've never really enjoyed writing documentation but at the same time in order for your software to be useful you need to provide documentation for it. So with that in mind I've started writing up some wiki pages here (with more to follow soon):

- [ServiceStack.TypeSerializer](http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/TypeSerializer) - The fastest and most compact text-based serializer for .NET
- [ServiceStack.Redis](http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/ServiceStackRedis) - A fast, feature-rich .NET/C# Client for Redis
- [ServiceStack.OrmLite](http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/OrmLite) - a non-invasive, lightweight ORM that persists standard POCO classes.

As always all Service Stack software is open source under the liberal [new bsd licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)

If you have a preference for other documentation you would like to see first just let me know.
