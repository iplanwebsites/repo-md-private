I have published a tutorial in what appears to be one of the first examples of calling XML REST Web Services from a MonoTouch application which (including full source code) is available here:

[http://www.servicestack.net/monotouch/remote-info/](http://www.servicestack.net/monotouch/remote-info/)

The tutorial also serves as a pretty good resource for setting up your own [ServiceStack](http://www.servicestack.net) Web Services Server.
