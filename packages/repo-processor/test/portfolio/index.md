## Welcome to My Creative Space

Hello! I'm Emma, a mixed media artist based in Portland, creating works that blur the boundaries between painting, collage, and textile art. My pieces explore themes of memory, identity, and the natural world through vibrant colors and unexpected textures.

I believe art should invite curiosity and create conversation. Each piece I create tells a story—sometimes mine, sometimes yours, and often somewhere in between.

## Studio Process

![Studio Shot](/api/placeholder/400/320)

My practice is deeply rooted in experimentation and intuition. I begin each piece with a concept or feeling, but allow the materials to guide me through the creation process. My studio is filled with collections of found objects, handmade papers, fabric scraps, and natural elements that often find their way into my work.

I invite you to follow my creative journey on [Instagram](#) where I share works in progress, studio glimpses, and the small moments of inspiration that fuel my practice.
